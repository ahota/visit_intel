Installing VisIt 2.8.1 on Blackrock

0. Notes and pre-requisites
1. Install VisIt on host Xeon
2. Patch host VisIt with OSPRay for Phi
3. Cross-compile VisIt for Phi

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Notes and pre-requisites

  - You should have the steps in setup.txt completed BEFORE continuing! This 
    means you have:
      - The Phi set up and accessible
      - An NFS mount for the Phi on the local disk
      - Intel compilers working with flexLM server running
      - OSPRay built for Phi
  - It's a good idea to have /opt/intel/lib/intel64 in LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
    installing. I have
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/lib/intel64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    in my .bashrc file
  - Make sure that icc/icpc and the flexLM server are working
  - I have
    export PATH=/opt/intel/bin:$PATH
    in my .bashrc as well so that icc/icpc are easier to call

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install VisIt on host Xeon

Get the build_visit script from here:
https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/source
These steps are for 2.8.1, but may/should work for 2.8

Build command:
./build_visit2_8_1 --console --vtk --cmake --python --szip --hdf5 --netcdf --silo --cc icc --cxx icpc --manta --makeflags '-j4'

1.1 Problems encountered and Solutions:

  P: CMake won't build--
     Error when bootstrapping CMake:
     Cannot find appropriate C compiler on this system.
     Please specify one using environment variable CC.
     See cmake_bootstrap.log for compilers attempted.
  S: icc/icpc aren't being found. Add /opt/intel/bin/ to $PATH

  P: Python won't build--
     ld: final link failed: Nonrepresentable section on output
  S: Intel's libimf.so (among other things) isn't linked. Add 
     /opt/intel/lib/intel64 to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  P: VTK won't build--
     CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:36 (FILE):
       file cannot create directory: /usr/local/lib/cmake/vtk-6.1.  Maybe need
       administrative privileges.
  S: VTK's installation directory is not set correctly. VTK needs to be 
     installed manually. In VTK-6.1.0-build, run 'ccmake .' and change 
     CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
     <base_visit_dir>/visit/vtk/6.1.0/linux-x86_64_icc/
     Configure and generate.
     Run 'make -j 4' and then 'make install'

  P: Manta won't build--
     make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
  S: cmake is never called on Manta. Manta needs to be installed manually
     using steps similar to VTK:
     In manta-2540/, run 'ccmake .'
     Change CMAKE_C_COMPILER and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to
     '/opt/intel/bin/icc' and
     '/opt/intel/bin/icpc' respectively 
     Configure
     Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
     '/export/ahota/visit/visit/manta/2540/linux-x86_64_icc/'
     Configure and generate
     Run 'make -j 4' and 'make install'

  P: VisIt won't build--
     CMake Error at CMake/FindVisItQt4.cmake:94 (MESSAGE):
       Invalid Qt4 Binary Path
  S: Qt wasn't properly built with icc/icpc. The easiest solution is to use
     the system Qt 4 installation by adding '--system-qt' to the build_visit
     command. You may have to add /usr/lib64/qt4/bin to the beginning of $PATH
     to use Qt 4.
     To try using the downloaded version of Qt:
     In qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.3/, run
     './configure -prefix <base_visit_dir>/visit/qt/4.8.3/linux-x86_64_icc/
     -platform linux-icc-64'
     Select 'o' for open source and say yes to license
     Run gmake (it takes a LONG time)
     At the end, it might present an error relating to gstreamer-app-0.10. It 
     seems that this can be safely ignored.
     Run gmake install

  P: VisIt won't build--
     Python can't find libpython2.7.so
  S: Add /export/ahota/visit/visit/python/2.7/linux-x86_64_icc/lib to
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Patch host VisIt with OSPRay for Phi

Git clone the dev branch of https://github.com/TACC/visitOSPRay
This will contain a src/avt/Plotter directory. Copy the contents of Plotter/
into <base_visit_dir>/visit2.8.1/src/avt/Plotter.

Return to <visit_dir>/src and run 'ccmake .'
The follow options need to be set:
  - OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR   = location of an OSPRay build. I built out-of-source
  - OSPRAY_DIR         = location of the original OSPRay source
  - OSPRAY_CMAKE       = the cmake/ directory inside the original OSPRay source
  - OSPRAY_CC          = ICC
  - OSPRAY_MIC         = ON or OFF depending on your build
  - OSPRAY_MPI         = ON or OFF depending on your build
  - OSPRAY_XEON_TARGET = AVX or AVX2 depending on your CPU

For example, I set these to:
  - OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR   = /export/ahota/ospray/phi
  - OSPRAY_DIR         = /export/ahota/ospray/src
  - OSPRAY_CMAKE       = /export/ahota/ospray/src/cmake
  - OSPRAY_CC          = ICC
  - OSPRAY_MIC         = ON
  - OSPRAY_MPI         = OFF
  - OSPRAY_XEON_TARGET = AVX2

Configure and generate the makefile, then run 'make -j 4'

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Cross-compile VisIt for Phi

VisIt requires VTK, which further requires OSMesa (since the Phi does not have
graphics hardware). VTK and OSMesa must be cross-compiled for the Phi before
installing VisIt. Instructions for cross-compiling these two are taken from
this site:
http://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView_and_VTK_on_Xeon_Phi_(KNC)

NEED TO CC HDF5 AS WELL
http://linux4hippos.blogspot.com/2013/05/cross-compile-hdf5-for-intel-xeon-phi.html

3.1 Cross-compile Mesa for Phi



I used the visit2.8.1 tar provided here:
https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/source

My Phi-mounted directory is /export/phi, so I extracted the tar to 
/export/phi/visit/
