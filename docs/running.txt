Using this repo

A source build of VisIt is required for the files in this repo to work. For
instructions on building VisIt, read install_visit.txt.

The gist is to download the build_visit script for VisIt 2.8.1 from
https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/source
with the following flags:
--console --vtk --cmake --python --szip --hdf5 --netcdf --silo --cc icc --cxx icpc --manta --makeflags '-j4'

Running VisIt with OSPRay rendering

VisIt works with a client-server pattern. The local machine is the client, and
runs the viewing window in GUI mode or the CLI in CLI mode.

The server can exist on either the local machine, or some other accessible 
machine, and the VisIt engine runs here. If the server is on your local
machine, the server is a separate process. If the server is a remote machine,
then VisIt uses RPC to control the engine on the remote machine.

If you are running completely locally, one installation of VisIt is enough.
However if you plan to use a Phi to run a VisIt server, you will need to
cross-compile the VisIt engine for the Phi. Instructions for this are in
install_visit.txt.

Current limitations:
 - OSPRay rendering only occurs on the engine
 - Pseudocolor plots are the only type of plot supported

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run VisIt locally (i.e. on Xeon only) with OSPRay

GUI mode:
  - Change directories to VisIt bin directory
    - e.g. for me this is /export/ahota/visit/visit2.8.1/src/bin
  - Run ./visit -gui -ospray
    - Optionally add "-debug <1-5>" and/or "-verbose"
  - Go to Options->Rendering...->Advanced tab, and select "Always" for
    Scalable Rendering. This will force rendering to happen on the engine. Hit
    Apply and Dismiss
  - Open any obj file
  - Add a Pseudocolor plot
    - e.g. mesh_quality->area
  - Click Draw
  - The viewing window should show the image rendered with OSPRay along with
    all correct annotations, including legend/colormap, and axes

CLI mode:
  -

To run VisIt + remote engine with OSPRay
(assuming remote engine is on a Phi)

GUI mode:
  - Change directories to VisIt bin directory
    - e.g. for me this is /export/ahota/visit/visit2.8.1/src/bin
  - Run ./visit -gui -ospray
    - Optionally add "-debug <1-5>" and/or "-verbose"
  - Go to Options->Rendering...->Advanced tab, and select "Always" for
    Scalable Rendering. This will force rendering to happen on the engine. Hit
    Apply and Dismiss
  - Go to Options->Host Profiles..., and click New Profile
  - Fill in the hostname, location of VisIt installation, and any special SSH
    command required
  - Under the Launch Profile tab, create a new profile, make any name, and add
    "-ospray" to Additional Parameters
  - Apply and dismiss
  - Open any obj file
  - Add a Pseudocolor plot
    - e.g. mesh_quality->area
  - Click Draw
  - The viewing window should show the image rendered with OSPRay on the Phi

CLI mode:
